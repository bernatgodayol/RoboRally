#### Small guide for using Git in an Eclipse Environment 

0. Clone the RoboRally repository in your Eclipse **[TO BE DONE ONCE]** 
1. `switch` to main branch 
2. `pull` (to have the newest version of  main) 
3. `switch` to new branch. ⚠️ name it something relevant, let’s say UserStory5 
4. Work on the project 
5. `commit` UserStory5 
   - `stage` all new changes → click on the the two-plusses sign 
   - Write commit message 
   - `commit` and `push ` 
   - Reload github and check if the push was succesfull. If not, try: `push head`  
6. `switch` to  main branch 
7. `pull` (to have the newest version of  main) 
8. `merge` main with UserStory5 
9. `push` main  → `push` head
