For getting a bit familiarised with the github dynamics I've found these articles quite interesting:

## Steps to follow in Eclipse

1. Clone the RoboRally repository in Eclipse.
2. Switch to the main branch using Git.
3. Pull the latest changes from the main branch to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the code.
4. Create a new branch (let's call it "UserStory5") to make changes on.
5. Make changes to the code.
6. Commit your changes to the "UserStory5" branch with a meaningful commit message.
7. Stage all changes you have made using the Git staging area.
8. Commit and push the changes to the remote repository.
9. Reload the GitHub page to confirm that the push was successful. If not, try using git push head.
10. Switch back to the main branch.
11. Pull the latest changes from the main branch to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the code.
12. Merge the "UserStory5" branch with the main branch.
13. Push the updated main branch to the remote repository.
14. Use git push head to push any remaining changes to the remote repository.
